4. It's used to specify that the function will not return to where it was call, thus running in a loop if no error is throw. The [[noreturn]] attribute is mostly used to make compiling programs handle errors faster because the process can be outsourced to another CPU core as it will run on a different stack call.\
\
5. A [[fallthrough]] attribute can only be used in a switch statement. It helps to let the compiler know that it's intended to have the fallthrough happen in a switch statement where there are no break; methods in the end of a case. You must have a version of C++17 or above to use this method.}
