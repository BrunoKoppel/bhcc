Hi,
I have had a few questions on how to run the packages example.
This will make it simple.

download the 2 attached files (Emprec.java   and  Emp_Ex.java)  to a directory that you create called
c:\packages

Now change to that directory      (   cd \packages  should do the trick)


Next set that path to your compiler
path = "c:\program files\java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin"  (NOTE:You may have a newer compiler !!!!) 

now type

javac   -d     c:\packages     Emprec.java

what just happened is that you created Emprec.class but it was placed in the
c:\packages\com\jhaley\pk1   directory.  THIS DIRECTORY WAS MADE BY JAVA  NOT BY YOU THE PROGRAMMER. 
THE ONLY DIRECTORY THAT YOU MADE WAS THE c:\packages   DIRECTORY TO PLACE THE 2 .JAVA FILES IN.  JAVA DID THE REST.

TO TEST THE PACKAGE TYPE
javac Emp_Ex.java
java Emp_Ex

Now you will see the output.
This is the simple way to do packages.  Please note all the times the keywork  "public"  is used.

OK, here is a question.  Why do we need to use "public" in the package code? 
I will post this on the Discussion Board.

Good luck,
Jack
