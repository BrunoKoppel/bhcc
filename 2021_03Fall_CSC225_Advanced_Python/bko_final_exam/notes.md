Perform exploratory data analysis for any dataset from https://data.boston.gov/. Do not use datasets already covered in class, or used in your final project.

Use pandas and/or in-built Python libraries to read and process the data.

Ideas for data analysis:
  - [x] Renaming columns

  - Identify missing data and filling it with values where appropriate
  - Grouping data and performing aggregate calculations on one or more columns
  - Creating visualizations using matplotlib, pyplot or other plotting libraries: visualizations could be histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, geographical maps, etc.
  - If using multiple data sources, what common values can they be joined (combined) on?

Ask 4 - 5 questions about the data that are answered by your analysis. Examples:

  - For the Rentsmart dataset, what are the most common violations, who are the landlords with the most violations, which geographical areas have specific types of violations, is there a trend in number of violations reported over time?
  - For the 311 Service Requests, what are the most common complaints, what is the average time to close a case per complaint type, how many complaints are received per day, what are the most common sources of complaints.

Submit your Python code and/or Jupyter notebook, along with the sample data (or a link to it) that was used for analysis.

If using Google Colab, please share your notebook with dsurrao@hotmail.com

Please note this exam is in the form of a take-home assignment, it is not timed, but there is a deadline as indicated.
