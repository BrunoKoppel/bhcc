follow that airplane/ of course I'm high this is/ an emergency
giant Scots terrier/ I thought I saw was known as/ Taxicab Mountain
round lumps of cells grow/up to love porridge later/become The Supremes
lady I lost my/subway token we must part/it's faster by air
viewing the dragon/there they ride slim through my dream/Carpaccio's pair
far shore Ferris wheel/turning glowing humming love/in our lit-up heads
Wind rain you and me/went Looking for a new house/o the grass grows Loud
Wind rain you and me/went Looking for a new house/o the grass grows LoudWind rain you and me/went Looking for a new house/o the grass grows LoudWind rain you and me/went Looking for a new house/o the grass grows Loud
