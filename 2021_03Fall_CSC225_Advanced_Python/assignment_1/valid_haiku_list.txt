night train whistles stars/over a nation under/mad temporal czars
sweet bouzouki sound/another syntax for heads/up to the aether
in you the in moon/its rays boxing in my mind's/hair hangs down right in
slow bloom inside you/the mnemonics of loving/incessant chatter
switch them to sleep now/the flying foxes swarm out/great it's flurry time
wind rain you and me/went looking for a new house/o the grass grows loud
