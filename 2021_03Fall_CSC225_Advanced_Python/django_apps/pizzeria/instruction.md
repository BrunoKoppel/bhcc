# Build a Django project to implement the Pizzeria website described in the course textbook (Python Crash Course, 2nd ed, starting from page 394 exercise 18-4):

1. [x] Pizzeria: Start a new project called pizzeria with an app called pizzas. 
2. [x] Define a model Pizza with a field called name, which will hold name values, such as Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. 
3. [x] Define a model called Topping with fields called pizza and name. 
4. [x] The pizza field should be a foreign key to Pizza, and name should be able to hold values such as pineapple, Canadian bacon, and sausage.
5. [x] Register both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some pizza names and toppings. 
6. [x] Use the shell to explore the data you entered.
7. [x] Pizzeria Home Page: Add a home page to the Pizzeria project you started in Exercise 18-4 (page 394).
8. [x] Pizzeria Pages: Add a page to the Pizzeria project from Exercise 18-6 (page 398) that shows the names of available pizzas. 
9. [x] Link each pizza name to a page displaying the pizzaâ€™s toppings. 
10. [x] Make sure you use template inheritance to build your pages efficiently.

Submit all code in a zip file from the root project directory, or place your code in a Github repo and submit the link.

I should be able to run 'python manage.py...' commands from your application directory to run your website, apply migrations, and interact with the shell interface.
